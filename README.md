## Used For this Project:

- React
- TypeScript
- AWS Amplify
- styled-components
- react-router-dom
- domain name from GoDaddy

## Planning to use

- babylon.js
- vite.js

What is listed above is currently being used. This is to be a starter project that will change completely while remaining the same end product. Starting out, the site will be built in React because that is the framework I am most familiar with. I chose to use TypeScript over regular JavaScript because I am a fan of strong types. I had touched AWS Amplify before, but not without step-by-step guidance from instructors, so I chose to use AWS Amplify here to get solo experience using it as well as to get more familiar with AWS. The domain name was purchased via GoDaddy. This is also my first time setting up a domain name I have purchased.
